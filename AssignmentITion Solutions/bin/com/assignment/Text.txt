2. Given a matrix of characters representing a place on Earth, where the value 'T' indicates the 
presence of a Tree at that location and 'O' represents there is no tree at that point. An orchard is a 
region with tress connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The size of the orchard is the total 
number of connected trees. Write a method to compute the sizes of all orchards in the matrix. 
Example input: 
[ 
['O','T','O','O'], 
['O','T','O','T'], 
['T','T','O','T'], 
['O','T','O','T'] 
] 
Note: Input can be in the code itself (it doesn't have to be supplied at runtime) 
Output: 5, 3 
If you are not able to get the exact output, still go ahead and upload the code. But ensure that your 
code is commented well with the comments explaining the approach.
